32-bit processor with Datapath and Controller designed to support various operations.


<h1> Latest Adjustments </h1>
<ul>

  <li> 10/27/2018 - Modify and implement logic for Mux32Bit2to1, PCAdder, and ProgramCounter Modules. Testbenches included for all of them with their respecitve waveforms produced (Behavioral and Post-Synthesis) included in their folders. </li>
  <li> 10/28/2018 - Modify and implement logic for Sign Extension Module. Testbench ran and verified with included waveforms produced (Behavioral and Post-Synthesis Simulations). </li>
  <li> 11/01/2018 - Implement 32-Bit ALU Logic for various arithmetic operations including: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> ADD/SUB/MULT </li>
    <li> AND/OR </li>
    <li> A<B, A==B, A!=B </li>
    <li> Bitwise Shifting: A<<B, A>>B </li>
    <li> Bitwise Right Rotation A ROTR B </li>
  </ul>
